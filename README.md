The goal here is to build a JavaScript class called FQL that will be a pure JavaScript implementation of SQL.  By working on this exercise, you will get a chance to explore how the inner workings of a database engine might work.

Fork and clone this repo, then `npm install`. Run these tests `npm test`. IMPORTANT: One thing to realize is that we've written a function called _readTable that will synchronously load a bunch of JSON files as an array of objects. For the specs we are loading the variables `movies`, `actors`, and `roles`.

At the start, all but the first spec is pending, as specified by `xit`. As you work through the specs, change those `xit`s to `it`s.

Work on these exercises and continue switching off each exercise with your pairing partner.
